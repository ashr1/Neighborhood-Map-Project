## Neighborhood-Map-Project

This app displays 8 default locations (gyms) around/close to Santa Clara.  These can be filtered by typing into the field in the side nav.
Clicking on a marker or list item will open an info window contained more information about the gym.


### Getting started

Open up index.html in a browser to start up the app. You can now use the app fully in the broswer itself.

If needed, you can inspect the code in index.html and structuredApp.js (which is the javascript for this application) with an editor like Sublime text.

### Credits

The google maps api was used to display the map and markers.

The location data was gotten from the Foursquare api.

Knockoutjs was the framework used for this app.
